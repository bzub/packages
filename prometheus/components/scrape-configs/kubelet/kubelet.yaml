# Scrape config for Kubelet cAdvisor.
#
# This is required for Kubernetes 1.7.3 and later, where cAdvisor metrics
# (those whose names begin with 'container_') have been removed from the
# Kubelet metrics endpoint.  This job scrapes the cAdvisor endpoint to
# retrieve those metrics.
#
# In Kubernetes 1.7.0-1.7.2, these metrics are only exposed on the cAdvisor
# HTTP endpoint; use the "/metrics" endpoint on the 4194 port of nodes. In
# that case (and ensure cAdvisor's HTTP server hasn't been disabled with the
# --cadvisor-port=0 Kubelet flag).
#
# This job is not necessary and should be removed in Kubernetes 1.6 and
# earlier versions, or it will cause the metrics to be scraped twice.
